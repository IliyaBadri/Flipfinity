1. General Naming Guidelines in C

    Consistency is key. Stick to a naming convention throughout your codebase.
    Descriptive names make your code easier to understand. Avoid single-letter variable names except in very short loops (like i for loop indices).

2. Naming Variables

Variables should be named based on their purpose or meaning in the program.
Common Conventions:

    Use lowercase letters with underscores between words (snake_case).
    Use meaningful names (e.g., int player_score instead of int a).
    Avoid using names that are too short (unless they're standard, like i, j for loops).

Examples:

int player_health;
float enemy_speed;
char *game_title;

Avoid:

    One-letter variable names (except for loop variables like i, j).
    Non-descriptive names like temp, val, data (unless they make sense in context).

3. Naming Functions

Functions should describe what they do, and use verbs or action words.
Common Conventions:

    Use lowercase letters with underscores (snake_case).
    Start function names with a verb to describe what the function does (e.g., update_score(), initialize_game()).
    For boolean functions, use a prefix that implies a yes/no answer (is_, has_, can_).

Examples:

void start_game(void);
int calculate_score(int player_health, int enemy_kills);
bool is_player_alive(void);
void update_position(float x, float y);

Avoid:

    Function names that are too vague or don't describe the action, like process() or handle() unless their purpose is clear from context.

4. Naming Constants and Macros

In C, constants and macros are often written in all uppercase letters with underscores to distinguish them from normal variables.
Common Conventions:

    Constants should be written in uppercase with underscores separating words (UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE).
    Use descriptive names for constants and macros.
    Use #define for defining macros.

Examples:

#define MAX_PLAYER_HEALTH 100
#define SCREEN_WIDTH 1920
const int MAX_ENEMIES = 50;

Avoid:

    Using lowercase or mixed case for constants.
    Defining short, cryptic names for constants (e.g., #define X 10).

5. Naming Types (Structs, Enums, etc.)

For types, the general convention is to use capitalized names in CamelCase or PascalCase (especially for structs or enums).
Common Conventions:

    Use PascalCase for struct and enum types.
    For typedef names, use capitalized names, especially for user-defined types.

Examples:

typedef struct {
    int x;
    int y;
} Point;

enum Direction {
    UP,
    DOWN,
    LEFT,
    RIGHT
};

typedef enum Direction Direction;

Avoid:

    Using snake_case for type names. It's not a widely accepted convention in C.

6. Naming Pointers

When dealing with pointers, itâ€™s helpful to include the ptr suffix to indicate that it is a pointer, though this is optional and depends on your style.
Common Conventions:

    Use descriptive names and append Ptr if necessary.

Examples:

char *player_name;  // Pointer to a string
int *scores;        // Pointer to an integer array

Avoid:

    Prefixing every pointer with ptr_ unless necessary (e.g., ptr_player_name could be just player_name).

7. Naming Global Variables

Global variables should be avoided as much as possible. If you must use them, ensure they have clear names to avoid confusion with local variables.
Common Conventions:

    Use a prefix to distinguish globals (e.g., g_).
    Avoid naming conflicts with other variables.

Examples:

int g_player_score;
float g_enemy_speed;

Avoid:

    Naming global variables the same as local ones (e.g., player_score being used both globally and locally).

8. Function Pointers

For function pointers, make sure the name of the pointer clearly indicates that it's a function pointer.
Examples:

typedef void (*ActionFunction)(void);
ActionFunction action = start_game;

9. File Naming

For file names, you generally use lowercase letters with underscores separating words (snake_case), though you might use .h for header files and .c for C source files.
Examples:

    game_engine.c
    graphics_utils.h
    main.c

10. Examples of Full Code Using Naming Conventions

#include <stdio.h>

// Enum type for direction
enum Direction {
    UP,
    DOWN,
    LEFT,
    RIGHT
};

// Structure for representing a player
typedef struct {
    int x;
    int y;
    int health;
} Player;

// Function to initialize a player
void initialize_player(Player *player, int x, int y, int health) {
    player->x = x;
    player->y = y;
    player->health = health;
}

// Function to move a player
void move_player(Player *player, enum Direction direction) {
    switch (direction) {
        case UP:    player->y += 1; break;
        case DOWN:  player->y -= 1; break;
        case LEFT:  player->x -= 1; break;
        case RIGHT: player->x += 1; break;
        default: break;
    }
}

int main() {
    Player player1;
    initialize_player(&player1, 0, 0, 100);

    printf("Player starting position: (%d, %d)\n", player1.x, player1.y);
    
    move_player(&player1, UP);
    printf("Player moved up: (%d, %d)\n", player1.x, player1.y);

    return 0;
}
